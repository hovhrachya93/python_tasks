# Python List and Loop

This project includes implementations for a series of tasks involving list operations in Python. Each task is defined in separate Python files and is intended to demonstrate different aspects of working with lists, including finding the longest string, capitalizing the first letter of strings, reversing a list, checking for a number in a list, counting string occurrences, partitioning even and odd numbers, and printing matrix elements.

## Files

- **`task_1_longest_string.py`**: Contains a function to find and return the longest string in a list and its corresponding index.
- **`task_2_capitalize_strings.py`**: Contains a function to capitalize the first letter of each string in a list and return the modified list.
- **`task_3_reverse_list.py`**: Contains a function to print the elements of a list in reverse order.
- **`task_4_check_number.py`**: Contains a function to check if a given number is present in a list and print "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
- **`task_5_count_strings.py`**: Contains a function to count and return the occurrences of each string in a list.
- **`task_6_even_odd_partition.py`**: Contains a function to partition even and odd numbers in a list, placing evens first and odds later.
- **`task_7_print_matrix.py`**: Contains a function to print the elements of a square matrix.

## Running the Code

To run all tasks, execute the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```
To run individual tasks directly, navigate to the modules directory and execute the desired file:

```bash
cd modules
python <<File name>>.py
