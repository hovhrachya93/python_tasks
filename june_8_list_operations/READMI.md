# Python List Operations

This project includes implementations for a series of tasks involving list operations in Python. Each task is defined in separate Python files and is intended to demonstrate different aspects of working with lists, including finding maximum and minimum values, calculating sums and products, and handling user input.

## Files

- **`task_1_find_max_value.py`**: Contains a function to find and return the maximum value in a list of integers.
- **`task_2_find_min_value.py`**: Contains a function to find and return the minimum value in a list of integers and floats.
- **`task_3_find_max_index.py`**: Contains a function to find and return the index of the maximum value in a list of integers.
- **`task_4_find_min_index.py`**: Contains a function to find and return the index of the minimum value in a list of integers and floats.
- **`task_5_sum_min_max.py`**: Contains a function to calculate and return the sum of the minimum and maximum values in a list of integers.
- **`task_6_sum_and_product.py`**: Contains a function to calculate and return the sum and product of all elements in a list of integers. The `sum` function is not used for this purpose.
- **`task_7_divide_elements.py`**: Contains a function to divide each element of a list by the length of the list.
- **`task_8_input_list_elements.py`**: Contains a function to input a number of elements from the user and create a list based on user input.

## Running the Code

To run all tasks, execute the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```
To run individual tasks directly, navigate to the modules directory and execute the desired file:

```bash
cd modules
python file_name.py
